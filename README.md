# Quota Count

<b>Displays current quota count</b> on ship monitors where "Profit Quota" and "Deadline" show up.<br><br>
This helps knowing on which quota you currently are, like Q1, Q3, Q10, etc.<br>
I made this because I couldn't find a quota counter ingame, so the mod makes it easier to set objectives like reaching quota 10, without relying purely on quota <i>values</i> or memorizing how many quotas were done.
