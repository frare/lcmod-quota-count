# Quota Count

I made this because I couldn't find a quota counter ingame, so the mod makes it easier to set objectives like reaching quota 10, without relying purely on quota <i>values</i> or memorizing how many quotas were met.

## Features
<b>Displays current quota count</b> on the vanilla ship monitors where "Profit Quota" and "Deadline" show up.
This helps knowing on which quota your crew is currently at, like Q1, Q3, Q10, etc.
<br><br>
Also displays quotas fulfilled on the "YOU ARE FIRED" game over screen.
<br><br>
Now configurable!
